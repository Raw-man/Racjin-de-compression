# Racjin-de-compression
In this repository you can find code for compression and decompression algorithms used in old PS2/PSP games by Racjin, such as Naruto: Uzumaki Chronicles series (PS2), Fullmetal Alchemist 3 (PS2), Bleach: Soul Carnival 2 (PSP), Naruto Shippuden: Legends: Akatsuki Rising (PSP), Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Impact (PSP), and many others.
Main contents of those games can be found in CFC.DIG files. Here is the tool for unpacking them: https://github.com/Raw-man/Racjin-de-compression/releases/
